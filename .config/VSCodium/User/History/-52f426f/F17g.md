### 📝 Description

Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository.

I created the repository including my .configs to facilitate the backup and deployment of my configuration files to easy deploy on new machines with the help of [_yadm_](https://yadm.io/). Some files are specifically customized for my personal use.

I hope you like it.
