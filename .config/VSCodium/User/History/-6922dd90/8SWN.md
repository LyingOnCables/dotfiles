# Setup

---

> [!WARNING]
> The installation guide is under construction, try it at your own risk!
>
> It is also meant only for Arch based systems. All other distros are not supported.

### Dependencies Installation

> [!NOTE]
> The names of the packages are from the AUR and Arch Repos; adapt them to your system. Most of the packages are available on other distros official repos (most of the time out-to-date).
>
> To install CLI/TUI specific packages in non-arch based distros, I recommend to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
>
> In the guide, I will be using [Yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) as the AUR helper. Be sure to [install it](../.local/bin/installYay) or change the commands to your preferred one.

- **Base Packages**

First, lets start with the required base packages for the configuration to function.

```bash
yay -Sy hyprland hyprlock hypridle xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland hyprpicker \
        swww waybar waybar-updates rofi-wayland swaync swayosd-git playerctl \
        wl-clipboard wl-clip-persist cliphist udiskie devify polkit-gnome \
        pyprland qt5ct qt5-wayland qt6-wayland pavucontrol \
        fzf jq eza fd slurp grim satty vivid fish starship \
        catppuccin-gtk-theme-macchiato catppuccin-cursors-macchiato
```

On the first line we have the hypr ecosystem packages and on the other lines we have the must have packages.

- **Graphics Drivers** (_Optional_)

> [!WARNING]
> Skip this step if you already have the correct drivers for your graphics card.

Chose one if this commands depending on your graphics card brand.

```bash
# AMD (Open Source)
yay -Sy xf86-video-amdgpu xf86-video-amdgpu vulkan-radeon lib32-vulkan-radeon vulkan-tools \
        opencl-clover-mesa lib32-opencl-clover-mesa libva-mesa-driver lib32-libva-mesa-driver \
        mesa lib32-mesa mesa-vdpau lib32-mesa-vdpau vdpauinfo clinfo

# Nvidia (Propietary)
yay -Sy nvidia nvidia-utils nvidia-settings opencl-nvidia lib32-nvidia-utils \
        lib32-opencl-nvidia cuda vdpauinfo clinfo

# Intel (Open Source)
yay -Sy xf86-video-intel vulkan-intel lib32-vulkan-intel vulkan-tools libva-intel-driver \
        lib32-libva-intel-driver mesa lib32-mesa mesa-vdpau lib32-mesa-vdpau
```

- **Optional Packages**

Now lets move to the Optional Packages (If you don't want to install any more packages, move to the Dotfiles Installation step)

```shell
yay -Sy yazi nemo kitty zathura zathura-pdf-mupdf qimgv-light mpv
```

Here we have some packages that you can replace with your favorite ones and are not required at all for the desktop to function (though it wont look the same). For example, the terminal (kitty), the file manager (nemo and yazi), the font (ttf-jetbrainsmono-nerd), the video player (mpv), etc.

Useful CLI/TUI packages

```shell
yay -Sy ripgrep riprep-all sd duf nvtop btop dua-cli bat pacseek sysz gtrash-bin topgrade fastfetch
```

Useful GUI packages

```shell
yay -Sy pika-backup vesktop-bin nwg-displays nwg-look gnome-logs galculator gparted nm-connection-editor
```

- **Icon Theme**

First off, we have to download the icon package from the releases page of their repo. You can do it very easily by using curl.

```shell
curl -LJO https://github.com/ljmill/catppuccin-icons/releases/download/v0.2.0/Catppuccin-SE.tar.bz2
```

Once you have that, its time to extract the compressed package.

```shell
tar -xf Catppuccin-SE.tar.bz2
```

And finally, move them to the ~/.local/share/icons directory.

```shell
mv Catppuccin-SE ~/.local/share/icons/
```

- **Fonts**

Install the following fonts:

```shell
yay -Sy ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-mono ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-common \
       ttf-font-awesome noto-fonts-cjk ttf-ms-win11-auto
```

After that, be sure to refresh the font cache:

```shell
fc-cache -fv
```

### Dotfiles Installation

- ### <samp>Yadm Method (**recommended**)</samp>

[Yadm](https://yadm.io/) is amazing. It lets you manage your dotfiles with git without the hassle of creating a git repo on your home directory as well as gitignoring a lot of files.

It also lets you pull from the repos that you set up on remote to your local repo and then push to your personal remote.

I'd recommend you to look at it if you want a more personal and advanced config.

For now, we are going to install it the simple way without to many complications and just to have an origin to pull and another to push.

Firstly, **be sure to backup your existing config files**. Then, we are going to install yadm. You can do it using pacman with the following command:

```bash
sudo pacman -S yadm
```

After that, its time to clone the dotfiles repo into your system using yadm.

> [!NOTE]
> If any file in your local machine differs from the one in the remote repository, your local file will remain unmodified. You'll need to manually review and resolve any differences.

```bash
yadm clone https://github.com/Matt-FTW/dotfiles.git
```

Congratulations, at this point your done installing the configuration!

Logout from your current desktop session and log back into the Hyprland session.

If you want to pull from my remote, commit or add any files you can do it using yadm and then the git command you want to use (pull, commit, add, etc).

Now, if you want to **add your personal remote**, use the following command:

```bash
yadm remote add origin <url>
```

Then, be sure to push your changes to your remote!

### Post Installation

Here are some things you might consider changing or adding:

- **Change Outputs**

Firstly, change the outputs defined in [this file](../.config/hypr/configs/monitors.conf). They are the ones defined for Hyprland to use, so is very important that you change them. If you wanna know what ID does your monitor has, execute `hyprctl monitors`.

You also need to change the workspaces associated with that monitor. For that, check [this file](../.config/hypr/configs/workspaces.conf).

For more information about Hyprland monitors and workspaces, [check the docs](https://wiki.hyprland.org/).

Now, for the Waybar to appear you also need to change the output definition on [this file](../.config/waybar/config.jsonc).

- **Change Default Applications**

To change the default applications by filetype, be sure to install [this app](https://github.com/magnus-ISU/selectdefaultapplication).

```bash
yay -Sy selectdefaultapplication-fork-git
```

If you wanna change the default apps used in the Hyprland bindings, change the variables over on [this file](../.config/hypr/configs/default_apps.conf).

- **Git Changes**

If you are going to use git, be sure to change the user definition as well as the credentials over on the [gitconfig file](../.config/git/config).

- **Laptop Additions**

  - **Bluetooth**

    Lets start by installing bluez (bluetooth support) and overskride (GUI):

    ```bash
    yay -Sy bluez overskride
    ```

    After installing the required packages, we have to start the Bluetooth service. With systemd is pretty straightforward:

    ```bash
    systemctl --user enable --now bluetooth.service
    ```

    Now launch overskride and there you have it.

  - **Brightness**

    Brightness control is integrated with [SwayOSD](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayOSD). It was installed in the first steps, so you should be able to change it. If not, be sure to read [this part](https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayOSD#brightness-control) on the SwayOSD documentation.

    If you wanna have automatic screen brightness, install wluma.

    ```bash
    yay -Sy wluma
    ```

    Then, enable the systemd unit.

    ```bash
    systemctl --user enable --now wluma.service
    ```

  - **Wi-Fi**

    To manage your Wi-Fi connections, I'd recommend you to install [iwgtk](https://github.com/J-Lentz/iwgtk):

    ```bash
    yay -Sy iwgtk
    ```

    After that, enable the systemd unit just like with wluma.

    ```bash
    systemctl --user enable --now iwgtk.service
    ```

    To manage all the other network configurations, use [nm-connection-editor](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/network-manager-applet)

- **Specific Configs/Information** (_Optional_)

Finally, if you want to take a look at some specific app configuration, check the READMEs from each app in their respective config folders.

Some configuration examples are:

- [fish](../.config/fish/)
- [neovim](../.config/nvim/)
- [browser](../.config/browser/)
- [yazi](../.config/yazi/)
- [hyprland](../.config/hypr/)
- [vscodium](../.config/VSCodium/User/)
