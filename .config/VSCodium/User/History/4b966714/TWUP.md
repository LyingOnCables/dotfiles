## ðŸ”§ Setup.

My editor of choice is [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), but you can change it to whatever editor you want. You only need to edit the fish variables file in:

```bash
~/.config/fish/user_variables.fish
```

And find where the EDITOR variable is defined.

Here's and example on how to change it to use VSCode.

```fish
# set -xg EDITOR nvim
set -xg EDITOR code
```
